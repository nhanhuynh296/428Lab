#Badminton Pose Estimation and Shuttle Tracking

To run the program, run any of the files and specify the input file within each program (Any video format works .avi, .mp4, etc.)
You will need openpose, opencv and numpy installed and I reccomend just creating a "conda environment" for them

A simple way to run everything is install numpy and opencv(Just via `sudo apt-get` commands) and install openpose according to the instructions in the git repo[https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose/blob/master/doc/installation.md]

I reccomend just using the default models generated by openpose which I couldn't include in this zip file since they were way too big (> 100MB for Learn File Submission)

If you really want to contact me, here's my email and I'll help you if I can:

The video file test_video_yonex.mp4 is the default file for both these applications, but you can very easily configure them to accept parameters from the command line or just modify them in code.
The files located in debug were made during development and contain rougher versions of the code I used for testing combinations of features and parameter values

The openpose code specified a /models/ folder to reference. You can either build your own models following this tutorial and substituting the downloaded datasets with your own (Has to match COCO or you'll have to modify the matlab programs - GNU Octave on Linux supports this and is free)

I reccomend just using the default models that are automatically trained upon setting up openpose for simplicity sake and also so you do research into how it works for your own app cause my models won't really help you.
